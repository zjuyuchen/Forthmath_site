<p style="font-size: 200%; ">
    <b>Y  = &#402(X) + &#949</b><br>
    &#402&#710 means estimation for &#402 <br>
    Y&#710 means the resulting prediction for Y. <br>
    <b>Y&#710  = &#402&#710(X) + &#949</b><br>
    <b>reducible error</b><br>
    We can potentially improve the accuracy of &#402&#710 <br>
    <b>irreducible error</b><br>
    &#949, no matter how well we estimate &#402, we can not improve it <br>

    <b>The focus of the book is the aim of minimizing the reducible error!</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Three question</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>Which predictors (features) are associated with the response?</i><br>
    <br>
    <i>What is the relationship between the response and each predictor?</i><br>
    <br>
    <i>Can the relationship between Y and each predictor</i><br>
    <i>be adequately summarized using a linear equation, or</i><br>
    <i>is the relationship more complicated?</i>
